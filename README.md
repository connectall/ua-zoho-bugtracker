# ua-zoho-bugtracker
 Bug tracking is the process of logging and monitoring bugs or errors during software testing. It is also referred to as defect tracking or issue tracking. Large systems may have hundreds or thousands of defects. Each needs to be evaluated, monitored and prioritized for debugging.

Working Condition:
1) Records are creating viceversa
2) Records are updating viceversa
3) Comments are updating from zoho-bugtracker but not updating from standard adapters due to URL Encoding.
---Raised a CAPROD to mitigate this issue.
4) Attachments is not supported due to API Limitation
